            <p>We have focused on making the DROP process as easy and interactive as possible. Once you have completed the registration you will receive a link to your Artist Profile. Your Artist Profile is the home for all your tracks and is your space to communicate with your engineer. You upload the stems for each track along with notes on the tempo, demos for reference and special requests. You will also have private access to the draft mixes with a direct comment section to leave notes for your engineer.</p>

            <p>Recording your own album is a huge process and we understand how daunting it can be to take your ideas from the band room to the hard drive. We are here to guide you through the various steps and the important parts you need to know. This page is your go-to reference point for what we suggest you capture and how you export your work before we receive it. Please choose between “Live Recordings” or “EDM and Hip Hop” below and get a full tracklist.</p>
